Property Dataset Analysis and Price Prediction
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a property dataset, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and building a predictive model for property prices. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights and make predictions.

Project Features
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values for numerical and categorical features.
Detecting and removing outliers using the IQR method.
Feature Engineering:
Creating new features such as property_age, TotalSF, and price_per_sqft.
Data Visualization:
Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and feature-relationship visualizations.
Machine Learning:
Building and evaluating a Random Forest model to predict property prices.
Training and testing split for robust evaluation.
Dataset
The project uses a structured property dataset containing:

Features: Details about property size, age, location, quality, and more.
Target Variable: PropPrice (property price).
